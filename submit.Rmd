title: "Submit a Project"

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

Propose a project by filling out the following:

- [Project - Google Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScJYmipt-UFaPbLfluu8idM9qHTyLDSMFJLic_VXIj6qni6tQ/viewform){target="_blank"}

The next time this website gets regenerated (for now manually; eventually every hour), the project will populate on the site (unless there's an issue with processing).

Thank you for participating!
