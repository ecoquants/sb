## Propose a project (closed)

Although the period for proposing a project is now closed (as of 2020-10-22), you may wish to submit or revise by filling out the following:

- [Project Proposal Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScJYmipt-UFaPbLfluu8idM9qHTyLDSMFJLic_VXIj6qni6tQ/viewform){target="_blank"}

The next time this website gets regenerated (for now manually; eventually automatically), the project will populate on the site (unless there's an issue with processing).

Thank you for participating!
