500-block-dumbbell-development,"500 Block ""Dumbbell"" Development","The purpose of this project is to turn the 500 block into a self-sustaining urban hub in the downtown area. The orange zone represents our ""opportunity site(s)"". The pink zone represents our ""outdoor open spaces"". The green zone represents where we want to ""repurpose existing buildings"". Put together, we are proposing somewhat of a ""dumb bell"" shaped configuration of development, which will connect the city parking lot (Lot 11) to State Street and Fig Avenue through existing and proposed Paseos. 

Lot 11 will be newly developed for mixed-use, multi-family and potentially light manufacturing. Our adaptive reuse will occur atop the existing commercial buildings along the East side of State Street. Our goal here is to provide 3 stories of micro housing above any of the existing single story buildings. 

For open space, we will be closing State Street in order to create permanent outdoor dining areas along with new pedestrian circulation. A new Paseo will eventually connect State Street though to Fig Avenue, spilling into an additional proposed open space represented by the area currently occupied by a gang of private commercial parking lots. The Fig Ave. open space would require providing alternative parking for a number of businesses along the West side of State Street. As such, this part of the 500 block development would likely occur at a later phase in our scenario.",8/26/2020 17:52:34,mgries@designarc.net,Overview,"Density regulations, Affordable housing, Parking requirements, Height increase, Story increase, FAR increase, Paseo plan",NA,NA,"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1KE2PI754_Wm8tqoNQccI8rg-K50SHD09, https://drive.google.com/open?id=1aMBwpMhrKposRc_aTfNw1JAXBAaGAOdk",https://drive.google.com/open?id=18amqdd3jdY7P3F0ILVpHS_UEcl6cAdyg,"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1kbqrY2Z97egPEXVEdXl7cjd50SnYPiPI, https://drive.google.com/open?id=1eT-qjD7vSbQM_6gLyoKjk_cnWQjFOJ1M",NA,NA,NA,"over $50,000,000","mixed-use, retail, dining, offices","mixed-use, dining, offices, multi-family",20 years,NA,stormwater storage under state street,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,./project_500-block-dumbbell-development.html,500B,500 Block Team B,500,500 Block
